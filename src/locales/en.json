  "tut_y-wing-1_step_0": "First, we must find a cell with 2 notes. This will be our pivot cell (Row:1, Column:2). Then, we need to find 2 more cells in the same row or column as the pivot, also containing 2 notes. These cells will be our pincer cells. One note in each pincer must match a note in the pivot, and the other notes in the pincers must match each other.",
  "tut_y-wing-1_step_1": "Now let's look at this highlighted cell where the pincers intersect. If this cell contains the same note shared by the pincers, we can eliminate it. In this example, we can eliminate the note 4 from this cell.",
